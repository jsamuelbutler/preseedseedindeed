## Welcome to Pre-Seed, Seed, Indeed

I'll give you the TL;DR version.

I ❤️ Data.  Ever since establishing myself in a career as an algo trader and hedge fund manager I've been enamored
with unique and novel datasets.  In 2014 I set out to invest in tech startups.  I could not find any comprehensive dataset.
I used this as the impetus to start a tech company that gathered data from early stage startups and helped investors 
aggregate data into portfolio level metrics.  This proved commercially unviable and I stopped my efforts in late 2017.
I won't go into everything I did wrong, but let's just say I learned a lot of important lessons.

I'm back now, because I can't shake this notion.  I truly believe that there are valuable data points to be extracted from
early stage founders that can give us unique insights into the ultimate viability of a company from the earliest stages.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm still curious.  I must gather the data before I can come to the conclusion that I am wrong.

For now, I will just enjoy the experiment for what it is.  Anyone reading can enjoy it with me.
